<div class="primer">
<p>A <em>thread</em> is a sequence in a program
that runs in parallel to other code.
Iced CoffeeScript has <em>cooperative threads</em>,
which means that:
<p><ul>
<li>Only one thread runs at once.
<li>Concurrency is done by switching between threads.
<li>Switching is only done at <code>await</code> statements.
</ul>
<p>Some new idioms that appear in these examples:
<p><ul>
<li><code>b = hatch blue</code> hatches a new turtle, wearing blue.
<li><code>b.lt 90</code> tells the turtle <code>b</code> to turn.
<li><code>await done defer()</code> waits until turtles stop moving.
<li><code>send 'go'</code> sends a message 'go'.
<li><code>await recv 'go', defer()</code> waits until 'go' is received.
<li><code>while true</code> repeats the enclosed code forever.
<li><code>touches orange</code> tests if the turtle touches
any orange.
<li><code>do -></code> runs the enclosed code as a function.
</ul>

<h3>Multiple Turtles</h3>

<p>In <span class=h3>Race Condition</span>,
the second turtle to arrive will draw a dot that covers
the first dot. The turtles run concurrently, and
it is is not possible to predict which parallel turtle
will arrive first.

<p>If order is important, insert <code>await b.done defer()</code>
before calling <code>r</code>.  The program will
wait for <code>b</code> to finish before moving
the red turtle.

<p>An <code>await</code> only pauses the current function, not
its caller. That is why the last two
examples run threads in parallel.

<h3>Synchronization</h3>

<p>It is important to let a turtle finish moving before reading
its state.  If <span class=h3>Line Follower</span>
did not <code>await done defer()</code> to let the turtle finish
moving forward before checking the touched color, the turtle
would still be in its start position when check is done.

<p>Even if not reading turtle state, an infinite
<code>while true</code> loop should contain an
<code>await done defer()</code> so that other threads
get a turn.

<h3>Communicating Between Threads</h3>

<p>Threads can communicate using <em>shared memory</em>
(sharing a common variable) or <em>message passing</em>
(sending a value from one to the other).  If a shared
variable changes very quickly or slowly, the thread
that reads the variable can skip a value or read the
same value twice.  On the other hand, a thread that
uses <code>await recv</code> will
wait to receive each message sent by <code>send</code>
exactly once without duplication or omission.
