<h2>100 Little Projects</h2>

<p>In the following pages,
the basic concepts of modern computer programming are shown
in a series of brief examples.

<p>
None of the examples come with explanations.  Just try them.

<p>Once you get a program working, stop and think about how
it works.  Make your own customized version.

<p>
Can you draw a violet with a stem?
Can you make a snowflake that really looks like
a snowflake?
And can you do these
things in an elegant way?

<p>For a tutorial introduction to CoffeeScript,
turn to the Appendix which begins after example set 26.
Also be sure to try the "help" command in the test panel.

<p>Enough advice.

<p>Let's play.
