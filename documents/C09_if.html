<h2>9. Using "if" to Choose</h2>

<p>In our hangman game, we should show where
any guessed letters are.
To decide whether to print a blank line or a letter,
we will need to use "if" and "else".

<p>Add four new lines to our program:

<pre class="editor" data-format="1">
write 'time to play hangman'
secret = 'crocodile'
<u>show = 'aeiou'</u>

for letter in secret
<u>  if letter in show    
    append letter + ' '
  else                 </u>
    append '_ '

</pre>

<p>Don't forget to line everything up, and remember to save it.

<p>What happens when you run it?
It reveals all the letters in "show": all the vowels.

<p>Our screen looks like this:

<pre class="example">

time to play hangman
_ _ o _ o _ i _ e

</pre>

<p>Here is how it works.

<p>The line "<em>if</em> letter in show" makes a choice.
<ol>
<li>If the letter is among our shown, it appends the letter together
with a space after it.
<li>Otherwise ("else") it appends a little underscore with a space after it.
</ol>

<p>Since the whole thing is indented under the
"<em>for</em> letter in secret</em>,"
this choice is repeated for every letter.

<p>Check the spelling and spacing and punctuation if
you get errors.  Take your time to get it to work.
