<p>Pencil Code is an open-source system<br>
that unites the CoffeeScript language by Jeremy Ashkenas in 2009,<br>
and Iced await/defer extensions created by Maxwell Krohn in 2012,<br>
with the jQuery-turtle plugin developed by the author in 2011,<br>
using the jQuery library invented by John Resig in 2006.<br>
This work is inspired by the beloved LOGO language<br>
created by Seymour Papert and Wally Feurzeig in 1967.</p>
