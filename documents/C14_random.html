<h2>14. Picking a Random Secret</h2>

<p>The only problem with the game is that it always plays
the same secret word.  We should use the <em>random</em>
function to choose a random word.

<p>Change the line that sets the secret
so that it looks like this:

<pre class="editor" data-format="1">
...
write 'time to play hangman'
<u>secret = random ['tiger', 'panda', 'mouse']</u>
show = 'aeiou'
...

</pre>

<p>The square brackets [ ] and commas make a list, and the random
function picks one thing randomly from the list.

<p>Of course, we can
make the list as long as we like.  Here is a longer list:

<pre class="editor" data-format="1">
...
write 'time to play hangman'
<u>secret = random [
  'crocodile'    
  'elephant'     
  'penguin'      
  'pelican'      
  'leopard'      
  'hamster'      
]                </u>
...

</pre>

<p>The brackets do not have to be on the same line, but we
do need two!  When we list items on their own lines, the commas
are optional.
<center><pre data-run="home();" style="color:transparent; width:300px;" data-width="300" data-noreform="1">
# scatter
ht()
hatch(30).plan ->
  @wear random color
  @rt random 360
  @fd 50 * abs random normal











# 300 pixels!
</pre>
</center>
