<div class="primer">
<p>The examples on this page gather input using
<em>callbacks</em>:
<p><ul>
<li><code>button</code> sets up a function to be called
whenever a button is pressed.
<li><code>read</code> calls a function once
after the user answers a prompt.
<li><code>readnum</code> is like read, but for numbers only.
</ul>

<h3>Awaiting Callbacks</h3>
<p>If a program needs to wait until a callback is received,
the <code>await</code> keyword: inside the <code>await</code>,
the <code>defer</code> statement stands for the callback.
After this callback receives a value, the program continues
on the line after the <code>await</code>

<h3>Randomness and Reassigning Variables</h3>

<p>The <span class=h3>Guess My Number</span> example uses
the <code>random</code> function to pick an unpredictable
number from 1 to 100.  (The argument to <code>random</code>
is a list of numbers to choose from.)

<p>The game allows five turns to guess the number, tracked in
the variable <code>turns</code>.
The <em>assignment</em> <code>turns = turns - 1</code>
means "set the value of <code>turns</code> to be
one less than the old value of
<code>turns</code>".

<h3>Booleans and Conditionals</h3>

<p>A true or false value is called a <em>boolean</em>.
The expression <code>turns &gt; 1</code> is a boolean that is
true when <code>turns</code> exceeds 1.  When used with
conditional words <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>,
booleans control program flow.  Other examples:

<p><ul>
<li><code>pick is secret</code>, true when the two variables have the same value.
<li><code>pick isnt secret</code>, true when the two variables are unequal.
<li><code>secret &lt; pick &lt;= 100</code>, true when <code>pick</code>
exceeds <code>secret</code> but not 100.
<li><code>secret &lt; pick and pick &lt;= 100</code>, the same thing
written using <code>and</code>.
<li><code>not (secret &gt;= pick or pick &gt; 100)</code>, again
with <code>not</code> and <code>or</code>.
</ul>

<p>Statements to be be run conditionally should be
indented underneath the <code>if</code> or <code>else</code>
line that controls the condition.

<h3>Callbacks Versus Deferrals</h3>

<p>It is worth thinking about how <code>await</code> and
<code>defer</code> work.  <code>defer</code> creates
a callback function that, when called, continues
the program after the <code>await</code> block.
The <code>defer</code> function is called a
<em>continuation</em> because it continues the program
where it left off.

<p>Chained callbacks to do multistep interactions
can be done explicitly.
<span class=h3>Polygon Revisited</span> does
exactly the same thing as
<span class=h3>Polygon To Order</span>: the
nested function is called when <code>readnum</code>
completes, and the innermost function is run
after the second <code>readnum</code> is done.
Think about how a loop such as in <span class=h3>Guess</span>
could be done without <code>await</code>.
