<div class="primer">
<p>To draw a rectangle, we could write the following.
<p>
<code>fd 50; rt 90; fd 100; rt 90; fd 50; rt 90; fd 100; rt 90</code>
<p>But that is wordy and repetitive.
The program <span class=h3>Rectangle</span> is clearer
because it uses a <code>for</code> loop to repeat the <code>fd</code>
and <code>rt 90</code> commands.

<h3>The Parts of a Loop</h3>

<p>Look closely at <span class="h3">Rectangle</span>.
The <code>for</code> loop has three parts:
<p><ul>
<li>The <em>loop variable</em> <code>d</code>.
<li>The <em>loop list</em> <code>[50, 100, 50, 100]</code>.
<li>The <em>loop body</em> <code>fd d; rt 90</code>.
</ul>

<p>The prepositions <code>for</code> and <code>in</code>
are special words in the language: they introduce a loop
variable and its loop list.

<p>Since the list contains four numbers,
the loop repeats the body four times: once with <code>d</code>
set to 50; then once with <code>d</code> as 100; then again
as 50; then finally as 100 again.

<h3>Loop Lists and Ranges</h3>

<p>A list is written by surrounding items with square brackets
<code>[</code> <code>]</code>.

<p>If you write list items on a single line, separate them
with commas.  Longer lists like the list of
colors in <span class=h3>Rainbow</span> can be written
on multiple lines for clarity; commas are not needed at
linebreaks.

<p>A range of numbers can be listed by putting
two dots <code>..</code> between the lowest and highest numbers.
If you use three dots <code>...</code>, the effect is similar,
but the last number will not be included in the list.

<h3>Indenting is Important</h3>

<p>The commands in the loop are indented underneath the
<code>for</code>
line to show that they are inside the loop. It is important to
indent lines inside the loop body evenly with each other.

<p>List items should also be indented evenly with each
other when written on separate lines.

<h3>Simple Loops and Stride</h3>

<p>Notice that the loop variable does not need
to be used inside
the body of the loop.  In
<span class=h3>Square Loop</span> and
<span class=h3>360 Loop</span>, the variable
<code>x</code> is
not used except to count the number of repetitions.

<p>In <span class=h3>Descending Loop</span>, the
word <code>by</code> after the list denotes
a <em>stride</em>, which is how much to skip
forward when looping through the list.  Looping
<code>by 2</code> would skip every other number.
Looping <code>by -1</code> counts down.
