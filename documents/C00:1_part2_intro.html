<h2>Hangman<br>One Project in Detail</h2>

<p>In this section, we use Pencil Code
to make a game of hangman from scratch.

<p>It takes a couple hours to learn enough programming
to make a game of hangman.

<p>We will learn about:
<ul>
<li>Memory and naming
<li>Computer arithmetic
<li>Using functions
<li>Simple graphics
<li>How to make a program
<li>Input and output
<li>Loops and choices
<li>Delays and synchronization
<li>Connecting to the internet
</ul>

<p>At the end we will have a game we can play.

<center style="margin:24px"><img src="pencilcode-first-small.png" width=371 style="border:5px solid lightgray;"></center>

<p>The <span id="leftside">left</span>
side of the screen is where you type in your program,
and the <span id="rightside">right</span>

test panel where you type code and run it right away.

<p>While exploring the projects in this book, you can also
use the test panel in the lower right corner to ask for help with
how commands work.
