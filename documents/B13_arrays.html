<p><em>Arrays</em> are objects that contain
a sequence of values.  Throughout this book we have
used arrays for iteration in <code>for</code> loops;
arrays are used wherever a program needs to organize
sequential data.

<h3>Referencing and Joining Array Elements</h3>
<p>The <code>i</code>th element of an array <code>story</code>
is <code>story[i]</code>, and
the number of elements is <code>story.length</code>.
Indexing is zero-based, so the first element is
<code>story[0]</code> and the last is
<code>story[story.length - 1]</code>.
<p>All the elements of an array can be joined together in one big
string by <code>story.join ''</code>.  The argument is the "glue"
put between the elements.

<h3>Await and Defer</h3>
<p>The statement <code>await read prompt, defer answer</code>
pauses the program until the <code>read</code> is done.
<code>defer answer</code> is a <em>continuation</em> function that
resumes the program after putting
the result in <code>answer</code>.

<h3>Building Arrays with Push</h3>
<p>A program can use <code>push</code> to add elements to the end
of an array.
<p><span class=h3>Primes</span> starts with <code>primes = []</code>
as an empty array, and then it calls <code>primes.push candidate</code>
to add each discovered prime to the array of divisors to check.
This ancient algorithm is the <em>Sieve of Eratosthenes</em>.

<h3>Stacks of Objects</h3>
<p>Arrays have a <code>pop</code>
method that reverses of <code>push</code> by removing and
returning the last value.
An array used by pushing and popping
is called a <em>stack</em>.
<p>It is common to use a stack of objects to undo
a sequence.  In <span class=h3>Push and Pop</span>,
<code>stack</code> is an array where every element is
a turtle position.
Each element is itself a two-element array containing
an [x, y] (itself another array) and a numerical direction.

<h3>Destructuring</h3>
<p><ul>
<li><code>getxy()</code> returns the turtle's current
[x, y] as an array of two numbers.
<li><code>direction()</code> returns the
current direction of the turtle in degrees.
<li><code>stack.push [getxy(), direction()]</code> reads
the turtle's
current xy coordinates and its current direction, forms an array
with the results, and pushes it on the <code>stack</code>.
<li><code>[xy, b] = stack.pop</code> removes the last element from
the <code>stack</code> (the element is itself an array),
and assigns the first item within of the element to the variable
<code>xy</code> and the second item in element to <code>b</code>.
</ul>
<p>The form <code>[xy, b] = <u>value</u></code> is called a
<em>destructuring assignment</em>.  It is a concise way
to give local variable names to the elements of a short array.
