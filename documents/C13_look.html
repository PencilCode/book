<h2>13. Making it Look Like Hangman</h2>

<p>It will be more fun if we make our game look like Hangman.

<p>All we need to do is draw parts of the poor
hangman person when there is a wrong guess.  Try adding
something like this to the wrong guess part:

<pre class="editor" data-format="1">
...
    write 'Nope.'
    write turns + ' more turns'
<u>    if turns is 4 then lt 90; rt 540, 10; lt 90         
    if turns is 3 then fd 20; lt 45; bk 30; fd 30       
    if turns is 2 then rt 90; bk 30; fd 30; lt 45; fd 30
    if turns is 1 then rt 45; fd 30                     
    if turns is 1 then fd 30                            </u>
    if turns is 0
<u>      bk 30; lt 90; fd 30
      await done defer() </u>
      write 'The answer is ' + secret

</pre>

<p>The semicolons (;) let you put more than
one step on the same line.  Notice when putting the
"if" on the same line as the commands to run, we must
use the word "then" between the test and the commands.

<p>Try making variations on the hangman drawings
for each step.

<p>Whenever we want to pause the program to wait for the turtle
to finish drawing, we can use "await done defer()".
