<p>The thee examples on this page demonstrate how to
simulate motion: a bouncing turtle, a game of tag,
and an orbiting planet.
<h3>Newtonian Simulations</h3>
<p>When Newton worked out his famous laws of motion, he discovered
that the speed and direction of an object - its <em>velocity</em> -
remains unchanged as long as no forces act on the object.  And he
discovered that forces do not directly change the position of
an object: forces alter an object's velocity.
<p>When simulating motion, the velocity of an object can be represented
by a small change in position for each tick in time.  An undisturbed
object moves the same distance and direction on each tick, and a
forced object will alter its velocity on each tick.
<p>In <span class=h3>Bounce</span>, the two variables <code>vx</code>
and <code>vy</code> are the x and y components of velocity.  The
gentle acceleration due to gravity is simulated by a slight
change in velocity on each tick: <code>vy -= 1</code>.
The sudden acceleration of a bounce off the floor
(with some loss in energy) is represented by a sign change in velocity:
<code>vy = Math.abs(vy) * 0.9</code>.
<p>In <span class=h3>Tag</span>, velocity is simulated by
moving each turtle forward 5 or 6 on each tick.  The physics
of this game are designed for fun: the main
turtle picks its direction by pointing at the last position of
the mouse.  The blue turtle runs away by adding 45 degrees to the
<code>direction</code> from the main turtle to itself.
<p><span class=h3>Orbit</span> is a representation of Newton's
most profound discovery: that the gravity makes objects fall
to the ground is the same force that governs the motions of
the planets.  In the orbital simulator, the x and y components
of velocity are in the array <code>v</code>, and the velocity
is accelerated on each tick using the formula
<code>v[i] += G * (s[i] - p[i]) / d3</code>, where
s is the position of the sun, p is the position of the planet,
and d3 is the cube of the distance between them.
<p>Click to move the sun.  Experiment with elliptical
and hyperbolic orbits.  Notice the planet moves more
quickly when it is near the sun.

<h3>Motion and Hit Testing Functions</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>move x, y</code> slides right by x and forward by y.
<li><code>getxy()</code> returns the absolute [x, y] position of the turtle.
<li><code>b.touches(turtle)</code> true if <code>b</code> touches the main turtle.
<li><code>inside(window)</code> true if the main turtle is fully inside the window.
<li><code>direction(b)</code> the direction from the turtle to <code>b</code>.
<li><code>distance(sun)</code> the distance from the turtle to <code>sun</code>.
</ul>
