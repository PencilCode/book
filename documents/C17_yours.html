<h2>17. Making it Yours</h2>

<p>The best part of programming is adding your own personal style.

<p>Try making the game so that it plays again automatically
after you are done.  Can you make the game harder or easier?
Can you give the player a reward for winning?

<p>Be sure to explore the functions in the online help,
and experiment with the examples in the remainder of this book.

<p>For example, you can add sound effects and music.
Try exploring the "play" function, and search the internet
to learn about ABC notation, chords, waveforms, and ADSR envelopes.

<p>Sometimes the simplest ideas can make a big difference.
The "ct()" function clears the text on the screen and the
"cg()" function clears the graphics.  Maybe this could be used
to make a two-player game where one person comes up with the secret word,
or where two players compete to guess the word first.

<p>You will soon find that the real fun of
programming is in putting your imagination into the code.
