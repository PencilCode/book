<h2>6. Making our First Program</h2>

<p>We are ready to set up
a hangman game.  In the the editor on the
left side of Pencil Code:

<ol>
<li>Select and erase the example program text in the editor.
<li>Now type the following program into the editor.
</ol>

<pre class="editor" data-run="home(); scale 0.7; jump -40, -75;" data-noreform="1">
<u>pen blue
fd 150  
rt 90   
fd 50   
rt 90   
fd 20   </u>

</pre>

<p>Press the triangular play button!

<p>If it doesn't work, check the typing carefully and try again.
Things to watch out for:

<ul>
<li>Spell each function name correctly and in lowercase.
<li>Do not indent any of the lines of this program.
<li>Remember to put a space after the function names.
</ul>

<p>Each time we run the program, it clears the
screen and starts again.

<p>Now, rename the program from "first" to "hangman"
by editing the name next to the
pencil.  Save it with the button at the top right.

<p>A website will be created with your account name.
If I choose the account name "newbie," a website is created
at "newbie.pencilcode.net".

<p>Once you have saved the program with the name "hangman," it is
available at two different addresses on pencilcode:

<ul>
<li>http://<em>yourname</em>.pencilcode.net/<em>edit</em>/hangman - this is
where anyone can see and edit your program, but you need your
password to save any changes.
<li>http://<em>yourname</em>.pencilcode.net/<em>home</em>/hangman -
here is where you can share and run your program without
showing the code.
</ul>
