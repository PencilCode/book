<h2>12. Improving our Game</h2>

<p>We can already play our game.
Now we should fix it up to make it fun.

<ol>
<li>The player should win right away when there are no missing letters.
<li>The player should only lose a turn on a wrong guess.
<li>When the player loses, the game should tell the secret.
</ol>

<p>Try this:

<pre class="editor" data-format="1">
write 'time to play hangman'
secret = 'crocodile'
show = 'aeiou'
turns = 5

while turns &gt; 0
<u>  blanks = 0</u>
  for letter in secret
    if letter in show
      append letter + ' '
    else
      append '_ '
<u>      blanks += 1</u>
  
<u>  if blanks is 0    
    write 'You win!'
    break           </u>
  
  write 'guess a letter'
  await read defer guess
  show += guess
  
<u>  if guess not in secret</u>
    turns -= 1
<u>    write 'Nope.'                    
    write turns + ' more turns'      
    if turns is 0                    
      write 'The answer is ' + secret</u>

</pre>

<p>Each time the word is printed, the "blanks"
number starts at zero and counts up the number of blanks.
If it ends up at zero, it means there are no blanks.
So the player has guessed every letter and has won!
In that case, the "break" command breaks out of the
"while" section early, even though there are still turns
left.

<p>The "if guess not in secret" line checks if the
guess was wrong.  We only
count down the "turns" if our guess was wrong.

<p>When we guess wrong, we also print a bunch of
messages like "Nope" and how many more turns we have.
When we are wrong for the last time we
print the secret.
