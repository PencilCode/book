<h2>4. Strings and Numbers</h2>

<p>What do you think happens when we try to do addition with words?

<pre class="testpanel">
> <u>'dog' + 'cat'</u>
  dogcat
> <u>'dog' + 5</u>
  dog5
> <u>34 + 5</u>
  39
> <u>'34' + 5</u>
  345
> <tt> </tt>

</pre>

<p>When we put something inside quotes, CoffeeScript treats
it like a string of letters, even if it is all digits!
That is why '34' + 5 is 345.  Quoted values like this are
called "strings."

<p>The Number() function can be used to convert a string to a number,
so that we can do ordinary arithmetic with it.

<p>The String() function is opposite, and turns numbers into strings.

<pre class="testpanel">
> <u>Number('34') + 5</u>
  39
> <u>String(34) + 5</u>
  345
> <u>Number('dog') + 5</u>
  NaN
> <tt> </tt>

</pre>

<p>If we try to convert a string to a number in a way that does not
make sense, we get NaN, which stands for "Not a Number".
