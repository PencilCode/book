<h2>8. Using "for" to Repeat</h2>

<p>We can repeat steps in a program with the "for" command.

<p>Try adding three lines to the end of our program
so that it looks like this:

<pre class="editor" data-format="1">
write 'time to play hangman'
<u>secret = 'crocodile'</u>
<u>for letter in secret</u>
<u>  write letter      </u>

</pre>

<p>You should see this:

<pre class="example" style="font-family:inherit">
time to play hangman
c
r
o
c
o
d
i
l
e
</pre>

<p>The program is saying: for every letter
in the secret, write letter.
So the computer repeats "write letter" nine
times, once for each letter.

<p>If it doesn't work, check the program and
make sure the line after the <em>for</em> is indented; that is
how CoffeeScript knows which line to repeat.

<p>Once you have the hang of it, keep the word secret by changing
the program to write underscores instead of letters:

<pre class="editor" data-format="1">
write 'time to play hangman'
for letter in secret
<u>  append '_ '</u>

</pre>

<p>Notice how "<em>append</em>" instead of "<em>write</em>" puts text
on the same line instead of starting a new line each time:

<pre class="example" style="font-family:inherit">

time to play hangman
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

</pre>
</div>
