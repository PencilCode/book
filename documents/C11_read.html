<h2>10. Input with "read"</h2>

<p>Our game is no good if players can't guess.  To let the player
guess, type:

<p>It works like this:

<pre class="example">

<u>await read defer guess</u>

</pre>

<p>"read" opens an input box and collects the input.

<p>The "await" and "defer" commands work together to make
the program wait until the read function is done.

<p>"guess" is the name of the input collected by "read".

<p>Try adding these lines to the
program:

<pre class="editor" data-format="1">
write 'time to play hangman'
secret = 'crocodile'
show = 'aeiou'
<u>write 'guess a letter'</u>
<u>await read defer guess</u>
<u>show += guess         </u>
for letter in secret
  if letter in show
    append letter + ' '
  else
    append '_ '

</pre>

<p>Adding "write 'guess a letter'" will let the player know when to enter
a guess.

<p>The "show += guess" line adds the guess to the string of shown letters.

<p>Let's run it.

<pre class="example" style="font-family:inherit">

time to play hangman
guess a letter
&rArr; <u style="border:1px solid; color: black; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 150px;">c </u>
c _ o _ o _ i _ e

</pre>

<p>When we run the program, it will show us where our
guessed letter appears.
