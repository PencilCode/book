<div class="primer">
<p>There are two techniques for organizing time in a program:
<ol>
<li><em>Queues</em>: process lists of events over time in sequence.
<li><em>Frames</em>: process snapshots of the world at regular
time intervals.
</ol>

<h3>How <code>speed</code> Works with Queues</h3>

<p>In Pencil Code, each turtle has its own <em>animation queue</em>
that is used if you set <code>speed</code> to any number less than
Infinity.  (The default speed is one.)

<p>Each movement command like <code>fd 100</code> adds
the motion to the turtle's animation queue.  When the program is
finished running, the turtle has the whole plan, and it runs
through its animation queue after your program is done.

<p>The animation queue works well for timed motions that your program
can plan ahead of time.  But if you are writing a game or
simulation that needs to respond to events in real time, then
you may find it more sensible to to draw frames.

<h3>How <code>tick</code> Works with Frames</h3>

<p>The <code>tick</code> command is used for frames: it calls the
passed function at a regular rate.  The optional first
argument is the frame rate (the default rate is one frame per
second).

<p>The <span class=h3>Countdown</span> example writes a
number on each tick callback.  It also shows how to clear
the callback once you are done: call <code>tick null</code>.

<p>The <span class=h3>Move Draw</span> example is a very simple
interactive program that uses <code>tick</code>.  100 times per
second, it runs a function that turns the turtle toward the position
on the screen where the mouse last moved, then advances the turtle
by one pixel.  Because each frame should be drawn instantaneously,
it sets <code>speed Infinity</code>.

<h3>New Functions and Variables</h3>

<p>Several new built-in names are used in these examples.
<p>
<ul>
<li><code>pause 2</code> adds a 2-second pause to the animation queue.
<li><code>tick 100, fn</code> calls fn 100 times per second.
<li><code>write "Time's up"</code> writes a message on the screen.
<li><code>moveto lastclick</code> moves the turtle to the position
of the last click.
<li><code>turnto lastmousemove</code> turns the turtle toward the last mouse position.
</ul>

<p>The <code>moveto</code> can be used with any Cartesian coordinate
or any object that has a position - it happens to be used here
with the special variable <code>lastclick</code>.  Similarly,
<code>turnto</code> can be used with any absolute direction or
coordinate.  The special variable <code>lastmousemove</code>
happens to keep the most recent mouse position.
