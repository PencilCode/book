<p>In CoffeeScript, numbers are unquoted.
The language treats numbers and strings differently:
<code>5 + 3</code> is 8, while <code>'5' + '3'</code> is "53".

<h3>Numerical Conversion</h3>

<p>Strings can be parsed to numbers using the <code>Number</code>
function; the <code>String</code> function does the opposite.

<p>CoffeeScript allows numbers and strings to be mixed, but you
should be careful when doing it.
Adding a number to a string will convert the
number to a string and attach it.  Multiplying a number by
a string will convert the string to a number and do
the numerical product.

<h3>Three Ways to Change a Variable</h3>

<p>There are three types of statements that change the value of
a variable.
<p><ul>
<li><code>++counter</code> the increment operator.
Putting <code>++</code> before the variable name increments
the value before it is used, and putting <code>++</code> after
the variable increments it after it is used.  The <code>--</code>
decrement is similar.
<li><code>counter += 1</code> the sum assignment operator, which
changes a variable by adding a value.  There are also <code>-=</code>,
<code>*=</code>, and <code>/=</code> operators.
<li><code>counter = counter + 1</code> the ordinary assignment operator.
Notice that the right hand side is computed
<em>before</em> the left hand side is changed.
</ul>

<h3>Floating Point Limits</h3>

<p>CoffeeScript uses <em>IEEE 754</em>
"double-precision" floating-point numbers,
which means numbers are stored using 64 bits.
Scientific notation is written with an <code>e+</code>
or <code>e-</code> followed by a power of 10:
<code>1e+6</code> is one million
and <code>1e-9</code> is one billionth.

<p>There are 15 digits of precision, and
every integer up to 9,007,199,254,740,992
can be written exactly.
There are also special <code>Infinity</code>
and <code>NaN</code> ("Not a Number") values.
However, not every
real number can be represented exactly:
the next number after zero is
<code>5e-324</code> and the largest number
is <code>1.79e+308</code>.

<p>The limits are expansive, so
for most practical purposes, you can treat
CoffeeScript numbers as if they were real numbers.

<h3>The Modulo Operator</h3>

<p>The <em>modulo</em> operator <code>x % y</code> computes
the remainder of <code>x</code> when divided by <code>y</code>.
In other words, it removes the largest integer multiple of
<code>y</code> from <code>x</code> and returns the remainder.

<p>The modulo operator is useful for divisibility tests:
<code>x % y</code> is zero if <code>x</code> is divisible
by <code>y</code>.  Euclid's famous algorithm uses
the modulo operator to efficiently compute greatest
common factors.
