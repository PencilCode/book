<h2>No Thresholds and No Limits</h2>

<p>The aim of this book is to teach you to write programs
as you would use a pencil: as an outlet for creativity and
as a tool for understanding.

<p>These pages follow a fifty-year tradition of using
programming as a liberating educational tool, with no thresholds
for beginners, and no limits for experts.  Seymour Papert's
LOGO is the inspiration. Start with a few lines of code, and
progress to writing programs to explore art, mathematics,
language, algorithms, simulation, and thought.

<p>The language is CoffeeScript.  Although CoffeeScript is
a production programming language used by pros, it was
chosen here because it has an elegance and simplicity
well-suited for beginners.  While the first examples
make the language look trivial, CoffeeScript has a
good notation for all the important ideas: algebraic
expressions, lists, loops, functions, objects, and
concurrency.  As you learn the language, remember that
the goal should be not mastery of the syntax, but
mastery of the underlying concepts.

<p>Edit and run your programs on pencilcode.net.
The site is an experiment in community learning:
everything posted is public.  Write programs
that would be interesting to others. Accounts are free.

<p>As you experiment by building your own ideas, you will find that
at first your programs will behave in ways that you do not intend.
Details matter, and persistence pays off.
If you are patient in adjusting and
perfecting your work, you will be rewarded with insight.

<p>Read, think, play, and create something beautiful.
