<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Here are a few other places to go to learn more.

<p>Learn more about programming in CoffeeScript with
the book <a href="http://autotelicum.github.io/Smooth-CoffeeScript/"
>Smooth CoffeeScript</a>, by E. Hoigaard (based on the book
Eloquent JavaScript, by Marijn Haverbeke).

<p>The await and defer keywords are explained well on Max Krohn's
<a href="http://maxtaco.github.io/coffee-script/"
>Iced CoffeeScript homepage</a> (search on Google).

<p>The website <a href="http://guide.pencilcode.net/"
>guide.pencilcode.net</a> has more example programs and
reference material to use with Pencil Code.

<p>Pencil Code is based on open web standards HTML5 and CSS3.
HTML is a rich subject. There are more than 100 types
of HTML elements, more than 100 HTML attributes,
more than 100 CSS properties, and an expanding set of standard
functions.
The best way to explore all these options is to search
on Google and consult the many books and
resources on the Internet
about these standards.

<p>Pencil Code is also built on jQuery, which is the most
popular open-source AJAX library for building browser-based
web applications.  Every turtle is a jQuery object, and
a Pencil Code program can use $.  Learn about jQuery at
<a href="http://learn.jquery.com">learn.jquery.com</a>.

<p>When you have further questions, turn to the Pencil Code
discussion group at
<a href="http://group.pencilcode.net">group.pencilcode.net</a>,
or look to the superb technical community on StackOverflow at
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>.
