<h2>7. Hurry Up and Wait</h2>

<p>Write a welcome message after drawing the hangman shape:

<pre class="editor" data-run="$('body').css({fontSize: '80%'}).append('<div>time to play hangman</div>'); home(); scale 0.7; jump -40, -85; pen blue; fd 100;" data-norun="1"; data-noreform="1">
pen blue
fd 150
rt 90
fd 50
rt 90
fd 20
<u>write 'time to play hangman'</u>

</pre>


<p>Notice that the Pencil Code Turtle is as slow as a turtle!
Unless we speed it up with the <em>speed</em> function, the turtle
takes its own slow time long after we have asked it to move,
and the welcome message appears before the turtle is finished.

<p>We can do two things to help with the slow turtle:

<ol>
<li>Change the number of moves it makes per second using "<em>speed</em>."
<li>Ask the program to wait for the turtle, using "<em>await</em> done defer()</b>."
</ol>

<pre class="editor" data-run="$('body').css({fontSize: '80%'}); home(); scale 0.7; jump -40, -85" data-noreform="1">
<u>speed 10</u>
pen blue
fd 150
rt 90
fd 50
rt 90
fd 20
<u>await done defer()</u>
write 'time to play hangman'

</pre>

<p>Now the turtle moves faster, and the program waits until the
turtle is done before writing the welcome message.

<p>A couple things to know:

<ul>
<li>Do not use a space between <em>defer</em> and the parentheses
"defer()".
<li>We can make the turtle move instantly by using "speed Infinity".
</ul>

<p>Even if you have programmed before, await/defer may be new to
you.  These keywords create <em>continuations</em>, and they are part
of Iced CoffeeScript.  To explore how they work in more detail,
look up Max Krohn's Iced CoffeeScript page online.
